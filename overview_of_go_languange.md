# Chapter 2 Overview of Go languange

I don't feel like writing a chapter introducing Go right now, as there are other materials already available. There are several tutorials on the Go web site:

* [Getting started](http://golang.org/doc/install.html)
* [A Tutorial for the Go Programming Language](http://golang.org/doc/go_tutorial.html)
* [Effective Go](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

There is an introductory textbook on Go: "Go Programming" by John P. Baugh available from Amazon

There is a #golang group on Google+
