# Chapter 3 Socket-level Programming

This chapter looks at the basic techniques for network programming. It deals with host and service addressing, and then considers TCP and UDP. 
It shows how to build both servers and clients using the TCP and UDP Go APIs. It also looks at raw sockets, in case you need to implement your own protocol above IP.
